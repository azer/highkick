Asynchronous, no-style, super simple testing tool for NodeJS.

Motivation
==========
* **No sphagetti:** The tests coded for HighKick seem very simple, apparent and familiar.
* **Continuations:** HighKick uses same callback concept with NodeJS. All tests run a callback passing an error optionally.
* **Nested Tests:** Before I started coding HighKick, I had needed to test the code generated by OneJS dynamically. Now, OneJS' main test module creates temporary JS modules and executes another test module against several dynamically generated NodeJS modules.

Installation
============

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:azer/highkick.git
$ cd highkick
$ npm install
$ make test
```

Introduction
============
Code your tests in a separated module;

```javascript

// tests.js

var assert = require('assert'); // highkick doesn't provide a new assertion library. NodeJS has a good one already.

exports.test_foo = function(callback){
  setTimeout(function(){
    try {
      do();
      something();
      and();
      callback();
    } catch (error)
      callback(error);
    }
  }, 1000);
}

exports.test_bar = function(callback){
  callback();
}

```


You can optionally add an *init function* that will be called before each test. 

*An init function* takes two arguments, first one is the options of the test, and second one is the callback that will fire the pending test.

Init functions may pass any number of parameters to the test functions. See the below example;

```javascript

exports.init = function init(options, callback){
  callback(null, +(new Date), Math.random());
}

exports.test_corge = function test_corge(date, randomNumber, callback){
  callback();
}

```


You may be wondering about the ```options``` variable that is passed to the init function (if you've defined one). 
You pass the ```options``` object to the highkick function itself, to run the tests.

In the below example, I create a new module and call HighKick, passing the tests module I've coded above.

```javascript

// run.js

var highkick = require('highkick');

highkick({ 'module':require('./tests'), 'name':'main tests', 'silent':false }, function(error, result){
  if(error) throw error;
  
  console.log('Ran '+result.len+' tests with '+result.fail+' fail(s).');
});

```

Only required option field is ```module```, feel free to skip ```name``` and ```silent`` fields if you dont need.

Let's call the module above;

```bash
$ node run.js
```

That's all. See test/ dir for a basic usage example.

More Examples
=============
I use HighKick in my OneJS project heavily. You may take a look at its tests;
